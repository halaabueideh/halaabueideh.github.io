 I'm Hala Abueideh, and I've always been a bit of a data enthusiast, constantly intrigued by uncovering those hidden relationships. My journey has been pretty wild, dipping my toes into different fields and picking up a solid knowledge base along the way. 
 <br> 
 From diving into data analysis complexity to exploring the mash-up of various disciplines, I love connecting the dots between seemingly unrelated stuff. It's like solving a puzzle where every piece has its own story. 
 <br>
 But when I'm not lost in the world of data, you'll find me in the kitchen, whipping up something tasty for my family. Cooking is my other happy placeâ€”it's like a delicious blend of art and science. So, join me as I navigate through this data-filled adventure, make connections, and sprinkle a bit of creativity in everything I do. 
 <br>
 I'm all about sharing experiences, insights, and some killer recipes that add flavor to my life. Let's dive in and have some fun together!
